# Inconsistent AsyncStorage Error in Expo

This repository demonstrates a common, yet tricky bug encountered when using AsyncStorage in Expo applications. The issue arises from attempting to access AsyncStorage data before it's fully fetched, leading to intermittent errors during component rendering.  The solution involves proper asynchronous handling with promises or async/await.

## Problem

The primary problem lies in accessing `AsyncStorage.getItem` results too early in the component lifecycle.  The asynchronous nature of `getItem` means the data might not be available immediately. This inconsistency makes debugging challenging, as the error doesn't always manifest.
